Last night about 12 o’clock, I was aroused by cries that Ithought must be those of a jackal – it proved to have been a man in theriver.  Six men had gone to our opposite neighbor Mr. Insingers, to roband steal.  They overpowered the night watchman, and one of them gotinto the house.  Mr. Insinger sent a shot at the man, who ran, followedby Mr. Insinger firing at him – the man took to the river, and found thecurrent so strong that he screamed for help.  The police appeared andcaught the man, who gave the names of the men with him.

They (she andJoe) got some donkeys and came at a walk all the way to the river, wherethey quietly aroused some of our sailors, who rowed them across to Luxorto the doctor.  He advised them to go at once to Cairo – and they noware on their way there.  It is a hideous experience for the poor things– a very bad case of opthalmia.
